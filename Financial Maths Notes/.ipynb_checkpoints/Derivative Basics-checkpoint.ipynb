    "### Futures Contract\n",
    "A futures contract is a legal agreement to buy or sell a particular  asset at an agreed price at an agreed time in the future. Futures contracts are standardized for quality and quantity to facilitate trading on a futures exchange. The buyer of a futures contract is taking on the obligation to buy the underlying asset when the futures contract expires. The seller of the futures contract is taking on the obligation to provide the underlying asset at the expiration date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some contracts call for physical delivery of the asset while others are settled in cash. The price at which the transaction will take place is known as the Futures price or strike price. The delivery and the payment occur at a specified future date known as delivery date."

    "A Forward contract or simply a forward is a non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or to sell an asset at a specified future time at a price agreed upon today. The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future assumes a long position, and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a short position. The price agreed upon is called the delivery price, which is equal to the forward price at the time the contract is entered into."

    "### Futures Margin\n",
    "Margin is a critical concept for those trading futures and derivatives in all asset classes. Futures margin is a good-faith deposit or an amount of capital one needs to post or deposit to control a futures contract. The margin is a down payment on the full contract value of a futures contract. \n",
    "\n",
    "Futures exchanges determine and set futures margin rates. At times, brokerage companies will add an extra premium to the minimum exchange margin rate to lower risk exposure. The margin is set based on the risk of market volatility. When market volatility moves higher in a futures market margin rates rise. When trading stocks, there is a simpler margin arrangement than in the futures market. The equity market allows participants to trade on up to 50% margin. Therefore, one can buy or sell up to £100,000 worth of stock for £50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Margin Rate for Future Contracts \n",

    "\n",
    "  Margin Maintenance is the amount of money necessary when a loss on a futures position requires one to allocate more funds to return the margin to the initial or original margin level. Closing or liquidating a position eliminates the margin call requirement."

The purpose is to reduce the cost, settlement risk and operational risk of clearing and settling multiple transactions among multiple parties.\n",
    " \n",
    "In addition to the above services, central counterparty clearing (CCP) takes on counterparty risk by stepping in between the original buyer and seller of a financial contract, such as a derivative. The role of the CCP is to perform the obligations under the contract agreed between the two counterparties, thereby removing the counterparty risk the parties of the contract had to each other and replacing it with counterparty risk to a highly regulated central counterparty that specializes in managing and mitigating counterparty risk."

    "### Pricing Futures\n",
    "When the deliverable asset exists in plentiful supply, or may be freely created, then the price of a futures contract is determined via arbitrage arguments. This is typical for stock index futures, treasury bond futures, and futures on physical commodities when they are in supply. \n",

    "When the deliverable commodity is not in plentiful supply or when it does not yet exist — for example on crops before the harvest or on Eurodollar Futures or Federal funds rate futures (in which the supposed underlying instrument is to be created upon the delivery date) — the futures price cannot be fixed by arbitrage.

    "### Backwardation and Contango in Futures Markets\n",
    "Contango and backwardation are terms often used within commodity circles. These terms refer to the shape of the futures curve of a commodity such as gold, silver, wheat or crude oil. A futures curve can be plotted on a chart of a particular contract by using an X and Y axis. The X axis contains the various contract expiration dates while the Y axis contains the corresponding futures prices. A normal futures curve will show a rising slope as the prices of futures contracts rises in time. An inverted futures curve will show a falling slope as the prices of futures contracts falls over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A contango market simply means that the futures contracts are trading at a premium to the spot price. For example, if the price of a crude oil contract today is £100 per barrel, but the price for delivery in six months is £110 per barrel, that market would be in contango. On the other hand, if crude oil is trading at £100 per barrel for delivery right now, and the six month contract is trading at £95 per barrel, then that market would be said to be in backwardation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contango and backwardation are curve structures seen in futures markets based on several factors. It is important to remember that the futures price eventually converges on the spot price. In other words, any gaps between the futures price and the spot price will close as contract expiration nears.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of the futures curve is important to commodity hedgers and speculators. Both care about whether commodity futures markets are contango markets or normal backwardation markets. In 1993, the German company Metallgesellschaft famously lost more than £1 billion dollars, mostly because management deployed a hedging system that profited from normal backwardation markets but did not anticipate a shift to contango markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../pics/contango.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal Backwardation implies that future prices for certain maturity are increasing over time. The idea is that hedgers of these commodities are essestially willing to pay speculators to take the risk of owning the commodity away from them. In Contango, the price of distant delivery price for futures contract exceeds spot prices and this is often  due to things like storage costs. Contango implies future prices for certain maturity are falling over time."

    "### How Companies hedge?\n",
    "Over the last several decades, the use of derivatives as a tool to mitigate and control risk has expanded significantly. Despite well-publicized abuses involving derivatives, the efficacy of derivatives as a means of managing economic and other forms of risk remains widely accepted. The evolving mix of users of derivatives in the last ten years has also impacted the derivatives landscape. Traditionally, commercial hedgers such as processors, mills and large corporations used derivatives to manage risks; today, while commercial hedgers remain active, much of the increase in volume in derivatives is attributable to non-traditional end-users, such as public companies, which have been active users of derivatives, most notably interest rate and foreign currency hedging instruments.\n",
    "- Short Futures hedges are used when company owns the asset already and expects to sell it in future. Eg: Farmers, Gold mining companies, Oil Companies etc.\n",

    "`Limit orders` are another order type but they limit the price at which the stock is bought or sold.  You can place a limit order so that it will buy below a set price or sell above a set price.

You therefore need to keep on top of your limit orders to ensure it does get bought or sold.\n",

    "Buy stop orders are put above the current market price and a sell stop order below the current price, with the potential benefit of reducing your loss or protecting your profits. Traders use buy stop order to limit a loss or to protect their profit on something they have sold short. They use sell stop order to limit a loss or to protect profit on something they own.\n",

    "### Option Contract\n",
    "- `Options`\n",
    "  Options are a financial derivative sold by an option writer or seller to an option buyer. They are typically purchased through a broker. The contract gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) the underlying asset at an agreed-upon price during a certain period of time or on a specific date. The agreed upon price is called the strike price$K$. American options can be exercised any time before the expiration date of the option, while European options can only be exercised on the expiration date (also known as exercise date). Exercising an option means utilizing the right to buy or the sell the underlying security. There is no free lunch with stocks and bonds. Options are no different. Options trading involves certain risks that the investor must be aware of before making a trade. Options are derivatives of financial securities – their value depends on the price of some other asset. That is essentially what the term, derivative, means. There are many different types of securities that fall under the label of derivative, including calls, puts, futures, forwards, swaps (of which there are many types), and credit derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that tradable options are contracts between two parties. The companies whose securities underlie the option contracts are themselves neither involved in the transactions nor the cash flows between the various parties in the market. In any option trade, the counterparty may be another investor, or perhaps a market maker (a type of middle man offering to both buy and sell a particular security in the hopes of making a profit on the differing bid/ask prices).  All parties it should be noted do not directly face each other, instead they face the options clearinghouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Call option`\n",
    "  Call options provide the option buyer with the right to buy an underlying security at the strike price$K$. The buyer of a call option is bullish and wants the price of the stock to go up. Conversely, the option seller (or writer) has to sell the underlying security to the option buyer, at the strike price, in the event that the stock's market price is above the strike price at expiration.\n",
    "  An option writer who sells a call option believes that the underlying stock's price will drop or stay the same relative to the option's strike price during the life of the option, as that is how they will reap maximum profit. The writer's maximum profit is the premium received when selling the option. \n",
    "  If the buyer is right, and the stock rises above the strike price, the buyer will be able to acquire the stock for a lower price (strike price) and then sell it for a profit at the current market price. However, if the underlying stock is not above the strike price on the expiration date, the option buyer loses the premium paid for the call option. Payoff is $(S - K)^+$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Put option`\n",
    "  Put options give the option buyer the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying at the strike price. The put buyer is bearish and wants the stock to go down. The opposite is true for a put option writer who writes a put option believing that the underlying stock's price will stay the same or increase over the life of the option.\n",
    "  If the underlying stock's price closes above the specified strike price on the expiration date, the put option writer's maximum profit is achieved. They get to keep the entire premium.\n",
    "  Conversely, a put option buyer benefits from a fall in the underlying stock's price below the strike price. If the underlying stock's price falls below the strike price, the put option writer is obliged to purchase shares of the underlying stock at the strike price. The put option buyer's profit, if applicable, is calculated by taking the Strike Price – (Current market price + Premium paid). This is then multiplied by 100 (if each contract is 100 shares) and the number of contracts bought. Pay off is $(K - S)^+$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Why use options?\n",
    "\n",
    "  A call buyer seeks to make a profit when the price of the underlying shares rises. The call price will rise as the shares do. The call writer is making the opposite bet, hoping for the stock price to decline or, at the very least, rise less than the amount received for selling the call in the first place. The put buyer profits when the underlying stock price falls. A put increases in value as the underlying stock decreases in value. Conversely, put writers are hoping for the option to expire with the stock price above the strike price, or at least for the stock to decline an amount less than what they have been paid to sell the put. We'll note here that relatively few options actually expire and see shares change hands. Options are, after all, tradable securities. As circumstances change, investors can lock in their profits (or losses) by buying (or selling) an opposite option contract to their original action. Calls and puts, alone, or combined with each other, or even with positions in the underlying stock, can provide various levels of leverage or protection to a portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the owner of that call or put option has an option that is \"in-the-money\" and decides to buy or sell the stock, it is said that they are \"exercising\" their option. However, just because an option is \"in-the-money\" it doesn't mean that it is always in the best interest of the option holder to `exercise` it. Most of the time the option owner is better off to just sell the option at the current market price. This is because the option price is usually higher than the \"intrinsic value\", or the amount the option is actually \"in-the-money.\" At expiration date, it usually makes sense to exercise the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why Trade Options?\n",
    "  - Option users can profit in bull, bear, or flat markets.\n",
    "  - Options can act as insurance to protect gains in a stock that looks shaky.\n",
    "  - They can be used to generate steady income from an underlying portfolio of blue-chip stocks.\n",
    "  - Or they can be employed in an attempt to double or triple your money almost overnight."

    "Put-call parity is a no arbitrage principle that specifies the relationship between the price of European put options and European call options, with the same underlying asset, strike price and expiration date. Put-call parity states that simultaneously holding a short European put and long European call of the same class will deliver the same return as holding one forward (or futures) contract on the same underlying asset, with the same expiration, and a forward price equal to the option's strike price.

    "1. The current stock price $S_0$.\n",
    "2. Strike price $K$.\n",

    "- The Impact of Spot Prices on Option Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "  The price of the underlying is the key factor that determines the premium price of an option. The options payoff is the difference between the spot price and the strike price. The price of an option premium for a given strike price will change based on the price of the underlying stock. Long call options are more valuable when the underlying spot price increases. Long put options become more valuable when the underlying spot price decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strike Price\n",
    "\n",
    "  The strike price is the contracted price that will be exchanged in the event of the exercise of the option by the option buyer. Hence strike price plays a vital role in determining the premium price of an option. The exercise price will remain the same throughout the life of an option contract and will not undergo any change, with the earlier-noted exceptions of relatively rare corporate actions such as special dividend announcements and stock splits. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Time to Maturity/Expiration\n",
    "\n",
    "  With more time, there is more uncertainty. The more time to expiration, the greater the chance that there will be fluctuation in the price of the underlying to the advantage of one of the parties to the contract. Thus, the greater the time, the higher the time value of the option. An option’s premium price is directly related to the time remaining till expiration. The buyer of an option stands to gain if the option contract finishes in the money. If there is more time to expiration, the chance of the option ending in the money is higher. As the time to expiration of an options contract passes, the value of the option erodes.\n",
    "  If an investor buys an option that is one year away from expiration, it will obviously be more expensive than a similar option that is only five minutes away from expiration. All options exhibit time decay and are wasting assets.\n",

    "- The Volatility of the Stock Price\n",
    "\n",
    "  The volatility of a stock price is a measure of how uncertain we are about future stock price movements. The standard deviation of the historical price movements of the underlying asset over a defined period of time is typically used to measure the volatility of that asset. The higher the volatility is, the more likely it is that an asset’s price will move up or down a lot. Thus, an option on a volatile asset is worth more than an option on an asset with little volatility. If a market becomes more volatile, the premium for option contracts, both puts and calls, would go up. Someone who bought options earlier would benefit if market volatility increases to the detriment of the person who sold the options to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interest Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "  The cost of carry depends on the risk-free rate of interest in the market concerned. The higher the interest rate, the higher the call option price and lower the put option price. The lower the interest rate, the lower the call option price and higher the put option price. Higher interest rates have two impacts on stock options valuations:\n",
    "  1. Higher expected return on stock.\n",
    "  2. The present value of future cash flows of an option decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all else is kept equal, an increase in interest rates increases call prices and decreases put prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expected Dividends\n",
    "\n",
    "  Stock dividends are paid only to the holder of the underlying security on the record date. Owners of call options on the same underlying stock are not eligible to receive dividends. Dividends paid during the life of an options contract reduce the price of the underlying. This has to be reflected in the price of options.\n",
    "  An announcement of a new dividend or an increase in the dividend of an underlying stock reduces pre-existing market call prices and increases pre-existing market put prices. A surprise announcement of a reduction in a stock’s dividends has the effect of increasing pre-existing market call prices and decreasing pre-existing market put prices."

    "  A bull call spread is an options strategy used when a trader is betting that a stock will have a limited increase in its price. The spread involves buying call options at a specific strike price and expiration date and selling an equal number of calls at a higher strike price for the same expiration date. A bull call spread is a type of vertical spread. A bull call spread is used when a moderate rise in the price of the underlying asset is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Since a bull call spread involves writing call options that have a higher strike price than that of the long call options, the trade requires an initial cash outlay, as you spend money on options premium. The maximum profit in this strategy is the difference between the strike prices, less the net cost of options e.g. ($K_2 - K_1 - C$). The maximum loss is limited to the net premium paid for the options e.g. ($C$).\n",
    "  A bull call spread's profit increases as the underlying security's price increases up to the strike price of the written call option. If the underlying stock price increases beyond the strike price of the written option, the profit on the trade does not increase.

Thus, an investor may take a long straddle position if they think the market is going to be highly volatile, but they do not know in which direction it is going to move. This position is a limited risk, meaning the most a purchaser may lose is the cost of both options. At the same time, there is unlimited profit potential.

A maximum profit upon expiration is achieved if the underlying security trades exactly at the strike price of the straddle. In that case both puts and calls comprising the straddle expire worthless allowing straddle owner to keep full credit received as their profit. This strategy is called \"nondirectional\" because the short straddle profits when the underlying security changes little in price before the expiration of the straddle.

They can be used to enhance the yield of the bond and make them more attractive to potential buyers. Warrants can also be used in private equity deals. Frequently, these warrants are detachable and can be sold independently of the bond or stock. \n",

    "- Warrants are issued by private parties, typically the corporation on which a warrant is based, rather than a public options exchange.\n",
    "  Warrants issued by the company itself are dilutive. When the warrant issued by the company is exercised, the company issues new shares of stock, so the number of outstanding shares increases. When a call option is exercised, the owner of the call option receives an existing share from an assigned call writer (except in the case of employee stock options, where new shares are created and issued by the company upon exercise). Unlike common stock shares outstanding, warrants do not have voting rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warrants are considered over the counter instruments and thus are usually only traded by financial institutions with the capacity to settle and clear these types of transactions.\n",
    "A warrant's lifetime is measured in years (as long as 15 years), while options are typically measured in months. Even LEAPS (long-term equity anticipation securities), the longest stock options available, tend to expire in two or three years. Upon expiration, the warrants are worthless unless the price of the common stock is greater than the exercise price.\n",
    "Warrants are not standardized like exchange-listed options. While investors can write stock options on the ASX (or CBOE), they are not permitted to do so with ASX-listed warrants, since only companies can issue warrants and, while each option contract is over 1000 underlying ordinary shares (100 on CBOE), the number of warrants that must be exercised by the holder to buy the underlying asset depends on the conversion ratio set out in the offer documentation for the warrant issue."

    "For an American-style call option, early exercise is a possibility whenever the benefits of being long the underlying outweighs the cost of giving up the option early (the benefits of being long the underlying outweigh the foregone time value of the option). For example, on the day before an ex-dividend date, it may make sense to exercise an equity call option early in order to collect the dividend. In general, equity call options should only be exercised early on the day before an ex-dividend date, and then only for deep in-the-money options when the dividend is sufficiently large \n",
    "\n",
    "For an American-style put option, early exercise might make sense if it is deep in-the-money. In this case, it may be wise to exercise the option early in order to obtain the intrinsic value (K – S) earlier so that it can start to earn interest immediately. This is somewhat more likely to be worthwhile if there is no ex-dividend date, which would probably cause the price of the underlying to fall further between now and the expiry date. This would usually require interest rates to be relatively high."

Like the delta, the gamma is constantly changing, even with tiny movements of the underlying stock price. It generally is at its peak value when the stock price is near the strike price of the option and decreases as the option goes deeper into or out of the money.\n"

    "### Neutral Portfolio\n",
    "To insulate the value of an option portfolio from small changes in the price of the underlying asset, one trader might construct an option portfolio whose delta is zero. Such a portfolio is then said to be `delta neutral.` Another trader may want to protect an option portfolio from larger changes in the price of the underlying asset, and so might construct a portfolio whose delta and gamma are both zero. Such a portfolio is both `delta and gamma neutral`. A third trader may want to construct a portfolio insulated from small changes in the volatility of the underlying asset in addition to delta and gamma neutrality. Such a portfolio is then `delta, gamma, and vega neutral`."

    "###  Dynamic Hedging\n",
    "A hedging technique which seeks to limit an investment's exposure to delta and gamma by adjusting the hedge as the underlying security changes (hence, \"dynamic\"). The strategy is frequently used by financial professionals working with derivatives. Derivatives dealers often find that they hold large numbers of short options positions on an underlier which they want to offset by purchasing long options, but that they cannot find long options because these types of options are not as available. To reduce exposure the trader will create a delta hedge of a non-linear position, such as an exotic option, with a linear position, such as a spot trade.\n",
    "The deltas of the linear and non-linear positions offset. As the value of the underlying changes the trader will have to take out new linear positions to offset the changing non-linear delta."

    "### Volatility Trading \n",
    "Volatility trading is the term used to describe trading the volatility of the price of an underlying instrument rather than the price itself. For example, you could trade the price direction of an equity index, but volatility trading typically means trading the expected future volatility of the index. Any instrument whose price moves, exhibits price volatility. Volatility trading is simply buying and selling the expected future volatility of the instrument. Rather than predicting whether the price of an asset will move up or down, volatility traders are concerned with how much movement, in any direction, will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How is volatility traded?\n",
    "  The most common way to trade volatility is using options. The value of an option is affected by several factors, but an essential determinant of its value is the expected future volatility of the underlying instrument, which is included in the pricing formulas as standard deviation. Other things being equal, options struck on an underlying with higher expected volatility will be more expensive than options struck on an underlying expected to be less volatile. Options therefore are a good way to gain exposure to the volatility of the underlying.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The price of volatility\n",
    "  The value of an option can be attributed to several components. By stripping these away, traders can imply an annualised volatility level that the option’s tick value equates to. This is known as the implied volatility. So an equity index may be trading at a certain price and it may have exhibited a certain realized level of volatility over the previous 12 months. Traders can compare this realized level of volatility with the current implied level as seen in the option market. However, there is a crucial difference here; the implied volatility level refers to the annualized volatility that is expected over the life of the option. In other words, it is forward looking and reflects traders’ current best estimate of what future realized volatility will be.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Delta Hedging\n",
    "\n",
    "  $\\Delta$-Hedging refers to trading in underlying asset alongside your options position with the ain of remaining $\\Delta$-neutral.\n",
    "   - `Example 1`: 1 Long Call on 100 shares, $\\Delta = 0.5$, This is ATM call ($S_0=K$). Worried about stock falling in value, therby call option value will also fall. By shorting ($0.5 \\times 100 = 50$)shares gets us $\\Delta$-neutral position. Lets assume $S$ rises to $S_1$, we calculate $\\Delta$ again and assume we got $\\Delta = 0.6$. Now we need to short 60 shares, so we short 10 more shares. Once again we become $\\Delta$-neutral. Now assume stock moves back to $S_0$, we recalculate $\\Delta = 0.5$. To be $\\Delta$-neutral, we need to buy 10 more shares. Notice in this example as price of the underlying rises, we find ourselves selling shares and as price falls we buy shares back. Lets say now the share falls below $S_0$ to $S_3$. Now $\\Delta = 0.4$, we now buy back 10 more shares to be $\\Delta$-neutral. As we keep hedging, we will be making drops of money(not alot) because we are *long* a call option and when you are long a option, you are long on volatility. As more price in underlying moves,the more we are finding ourselves having to hedge and the more money we are generating by hedging(selling high and buying low). This profit is not free money as it comes from the premium we paid for the option. Should the underlying move by the amount that was implied in implied volatility when we bought the option, we probably make back all the money spent in premium bu volatility hedging. If prices didn't move enough as much as implied volatility, we would lose money(premium). If Volatility $>$ implied volatility, the hedging will make more money than spent on premium. So this is $\\Delta$-hedging generating profit based on volatility.\n",
    "   \n",
    "  - `Example 2`: Lets compare `Volatility Trader(VT)` who is $\\Delta$-neutral and `Directional Trader(DT)`. $S_0 = 20$\n",
    "  \n",
    "     - DT: Buys 1000 puts £1. (Bearish)\n",
    "     - VT: Short 1000 puts and shorts 300 shares. (Neutral on $S$)\n",
    "     \n",
    "    VT has no view on the direction but on volatility. VT will sell put to DT only if they feel they'll be adequately compensated in terms of implied volatility. They will sell only high priced options and delta hedge until maturity hoping to make profit as in previous example. VT sells 1000 puts to DT and calculates $\\Delta$. Assume $\\Delta = -0.3$, so they sell 300 shares in order to hedge and become $\\Delta$-neutral. If price falls to $S_1$ by 1%, VT recalculates $\\Delta = -0.4$, VT sells another 100 shares to 400 shares total sold. If price of stock rises 2% to $S_2$, VT recalculates $\\Delta = -0.2$. They now but back 200 shares of their short. Now they are $\\Delta$-neutral with 200 shorts. In this case VT will be always selling low and buying high and its costing them money. They are losing money in this example by hedging because they are shorting volatility and as price moves the more volatile it is and more they have to hedge and more they hedge the more money they lose. If the price of underlying moves in line with expected implied volatility of the market, we lose all money received in the premium by the hedging."

    "### Volatility arbitrage\n",
    "In real world assumptions of the Black-Scholes model is not true. Traders can't hedge continuously(Like every millisecond). Equally, the underlying asset doesn't behave like Geometric brownian motion. $\\sigma$ is not constant for the life of an option. Because of these difficulties with perfectly and risklessly $\\Delta$-hedging options, Volatility Traders/Market makers charge small premium to sell options above the Black-Scholes price. They need to be compensated for cost of selling us this this product.\n",

    "Volatility arbitrage is a type of statistical arbitrage thats implemented by trading in $\\Delta$-neutral portfolio of option and its underlying. The aim is to profit from the difference between the forecasted price-volatility of an asset, like a stock, and the implied volatility of options on that asset. This is not traditional arbitrage situation as this is Volatility Trader's forecast of volatility and may or may not be realised in future.\n",
    "Volatility Trader attempt to buy volatility when they believe it to be low and sell volatility when they believe it to be high. They don't care about direction of underlying asset. If volatility Trader buy option and hedge the $\\Delta$, they are long volatility and if they sell option and hedge $\\Delta$, then they are short volatility. So, `long option ---> long volatility` and `Short option ---> Short volatility`. The directional component risk is eliminated through $\\Delta$-hedging. So over the holding period, our Trader will realize a profit on the trade if the underlying realized volatility is closer to Traders forecast than it is to Markets implied volatility. The profit is extracted from trade through the continual rehedging required to keep our portfolio $\\Delta$-neutral.\n",

This hedging generates profit/loss if underlying realizes the same volatility as was implied then your hedging will cost you same amount of premium you received or generate profit equal to premium paid out.\n",
    "- `Example`: Long Call option with implied volatility = 16% and short underlying against it to be $\\Delta$-neutral. ($\\Delta = 0.5$)\n",
    "\n",
    "  16% implied vol means that the market believes that a 1 std dev move in the underlier over the life of the option will be 1%. If the market never moved again between initiating this position, our delta would never change, and we would not be adjusting our hedge at all. We would have lost the entire premium we paid, and made no money on the hedge. Conversely, the seller of the option, would have received the full premium, have never had to re-hedge, and got to keep the whole amount.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  If the market instantly starts moving a lot. The stock falls to zero, the delta thus collapses to zero, thus we have to buy back all of our underlier that we were short. The stock then rockets so high that our delta becomes 1. We have to sell the entire notional amount. The stock keeps swinging wildly, each time it falls we have to buy, each time it rises we have to sell in order to remain flat, we are making large profits on these buys and sells, which are far in excess of what we paid out in premium. Conversely, the seller of the option, would have received the full premium, but would have been doing the opposite of our trades and lost a fortune.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does Volatility Arbitrage Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "  The price of an option is driven by the volatility of the underlying asset. If the forecasted and implied volatilities differ, there will be a discrepancy between the expected price of the option and its actual market price.\n",
    "  A volatility arbitrage strategy can be implemented through a delta-neutral portfolio consisting of an option and its underlying asset. For example, if a trader thought a stock option was underpriced because implied volatility was too low, they may buy a call option and combine that with a short position in the underlying stock to profit from that forecast. If the price of the stock doesn't move, but the implied volatility used to price that option rises, then the price of the option will rise. Even if this does not get recognized by the market, but the stock realizes higher volatility than was implied in the initial price, the trading strategy will generate a profit for the trader. Alternatively, if the trader believes that implied volatility is too high and will fall, then they may decide to take a long position in the stock and a short position in a put option. Assuming the stock's price doesn't move, the trader may profit as the option falls in value with a decline in implied volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several assumptions a trader must make, which will increase the complexity of a volatility arbitrage strategy. First, the investor must be right about whether implied volatility really is over or underpriced. Second, the investor must be correct about the amount of time it will take for the strategy to profit or time value erosion could outpace any potential gains. Finally, if the price of the underlying stock moves more quickly than expected the strategy will have to be adjusted, which may be expensive or impossible depending on market conditions."

    "### The Volatility Smile\n",
    "The volatility smile is a real-life pattern that is observed when different strikes of option, with the same underlying and same expiration date are plotted on a graph.\n",
    "Volatility smiles are implied volatility patterns that arise in pricing financial options. It corresponds to finding one single parameter (implied volatility) that is needed to be modified for the Black-Scholes formula to fit market prices. In particular for a given expiration, options whose strike price differs substantially from the underlying asset's price command higher prices (and thus implied volatilities) than what is suggested by standard option pricing models. These options are said to be either deep in-the-money or out-of-the-money. \n",
    "\n",
    "Graphing implied volatilities against strike prices for a given expiry yields a skewed \"smile\" instead of the expected flat surface. The pattern differs across various markets. Equity options traded in American markets did not show a volatility smile before the Crash of 1987 but began showing one afterwards. It is believed that investor reassessments of the probabilities of fat-tail have led to higher prices for out-of-the-money options. This anomaly implies deficiencies in the standard Black-Scholes option pricing model which assumes constant volatility and log-normal distributions of underlying asset returns. Empirical asset returns distributions, however, tend to exhibit fat-tails (kurtosis) and skew. Modelling the volatility smile is an active area of research in quantitative finance, and better pricing models such as the stochastic volatility model partially address this issue. \n",
