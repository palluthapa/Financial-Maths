# Financial Mathematics
In this GitHub repository, you'll discover a collection of projects reflecting my expertise in quantitative finance and time series modeling. These projects encompass a range of endeavors, including portfolio optimization, risk management, and options pricing. I've implemented various quantitative techniques such as the Calibrated Markowitz model to derive optimal portfolios and efficient frontiers based on market data. Additionally, I've tackled multi-period portfolio optimization problems, employing discrete-time investment strategies to maximize returns while managing risk effectively. Moreover, I've delved into derivative pricing and risk assessment by building options pricing models, including the Black-Scholes model, and implementing methodologies such as Monte Carlo simulation and finite difference methods. In parallel, I've explored time series modeling techniques, developing models for forecasting and analyzing financial data. Through these projects, I've honed my skills in quantitative analysis, financial modeling, and time series forecasting, showcasing my proficiency in addressing complex financial challenges.
